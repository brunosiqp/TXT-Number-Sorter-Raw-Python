# TXT Number Sorter – Raw Python

A simple Python script to organize numeric lists stored in a TXT file. Perfect when you have a messy list of numbers and just want them sorted without any extra fluff.

## How it works

The script:
- Reads the `ordenar.txt` file
- Converts each line to an integer
- Sorts all numbers
- Saves the result into `ordenados.txt`

## Requirements

- Python 3 installed

## How to use

1. Create a file named `ordenar.txt` in the same directory as the script.
2. Add your numbers, one per line.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python ordenar.py
